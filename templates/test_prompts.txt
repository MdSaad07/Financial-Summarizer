TEST PROMPTS FOR COMPREHENSIVE REPORTS (ANTI-HALLUCINATION VERSION)
======================================================================

⚠️ CRITICAL IMPROVEMENT NOTES:
- System now enforces STRICT data fidelity rules
- Segments validated against source documents ONLY
- No estimates or projections unless explicitly disclosed
- Mathematical validation for all calculations
- Enhanced disclaimers for data transparency

OPTION 1: Strict Data Fidelity Report (RECOMMENDED)
----------------------------------------------------
Generate a comprehensive financial assessment report with STRICT adherence to source document data.

🚨 CRITICAL RULES TO ENFORCE:
1. Business Segments: Extract ONLY segments explicitly named in the Annual Report. Do NOT invent segments.
2. Financial Figures: Use EXACT published numbers from documents. NO estimates, projections, or hallucinations.
3. Validation: Verify Revenue > EBITDA > PBT > PAT hierarchy. Flag any inconsistencies.
4. Disclaimers: If any data is unavailable, state clearly "Data not disclosed in available documents"

Report Structure Required:
1. Summary / Overview (facts from documents only)
2. Key Positives & Negatives (as stated in report)
3. Consolidated Financial Performance - YoY table with EXACT figures
4. Financial Ratios - with plausibility checks (e.g., ITC debt-free = Debt-Equity ~0.00)
5. Standalone Performance (only if disclosed)
6. Segment Information - VALIDATE segment names against source
7. Management Discussion (extract from MD&A only)
8. Future Outlook (only stated guidance)
9. References
10. Data Fidelity Disclaimer - confirm all figures are from source documents
11. AI Consistency Check - verify segment names, calculations, plausibility

Extract all numbers from the annual report. Do NOT generate or estimate any figures.


OPTION 2: ITC Limited Specific - Anti-Hallucination Test
--------------------------------------------------------
Create a detailed financial report for ITC Limited with enhanced validation:

**Segment Validation:**
⚠️ ITC's OFFICIAL segments are: FMCG, Hotels, Agri Business, Paperboards & Packaging
⚠️ DO NOT include: Cement, Electronics, Engineering, or any other segments
⚠️ Use exact terminology from Annual Report

**Financial Data Validation:**
⚠️ ITC typical revenue range: ₹60,000-70,000 Cr (FY2024-2025)
⚠️ ITC is virtually debt-free: Debt-Equity ratio should be ~0.00 to 0.05
⚠️ FMCG margins: EBITDA 35-40%, PAT 20-25%
⚠️ Verify: Revenue > EBITDA > PBT > PAT (must hold true)

**Consolidated Financials (Extract EXACT numbers):**
| Particulars | FY 2025 | FY 2024 | YoY % |
|-------------|---------|---------|-------|
| Revenue from Operations | | | |
| EBITDA | | | |
| Profit Before Tax | | | |
| Profit After Tax | | | |
| EBITDA Margin % | | | |
| PAT Margin % | | | |

**Key Ratios (Extract EXACT numbers):**
| Ratio | FY 2025 | FY 2024 | Plausibility Check |
|-------|---------|---------|-------------------|
| Debt-Equity Ratio | | | Should be ~0.00 for ITC |
| Current Ratio | | | Typical 1.5-2.5 |
| Return on Equity % | | | Should be 15-25% |
| Interest Coverage | | | Very high (low debt) |

**Segment Performance (OFFICIAL segments ONLY):**
List: FMCG, Hotels, Agri Business, Paperboards & Packaging
For each: Revenue FY2025, Revenue FY2024, YoY %, EBIT Margin

**Data Fidelity Check:**
✓ All segment names verified against Annual Report
✓ No hallucinated financial figures
✓ Mathematical consistency validated
✓ Disclaimer added for any unavailable data


OPTION 3: Quick Validation Test
--------------------------------
Provide a financial summary with strict validation:

**Required Data:**
- Company Name: [Extract exact name]
- Fiscal Year: [Confirm from document]
- Total Revenue FY2025 vs FY2024 (EXACT figures only)
- Profit After Tax FY2025 vs FY2024 (EXACT figures only)
- EBITDA Margin and PAT Margin for both years (CALCULATE and VERIFY)
- Business segments (list ONLY official segments from report)
- Key developments (ONLY those mentioned in documents)

**Validation Checklist:**
□ Revenue > EBITDA > PBT > PAT ✓
□ Margins calculated correctly ✓
□ Segment names match source document ✓
□ No estimated/projected figures without disclosure ✓
□ Debt-Equity aligns with company profile ✓


OPTION 4: Error Detection & Correction Mode
-------------------------------------------
Generate a financial report with ACTIVE error detection:

For each data point extracted:
1. Verify it exists in the source document
2. Check mathematical consistency (margins, YoY %)
3. Cross-check plausibility (e.g., EBITDA can't exceed Revenue)
4. Flag any anomalies with [DATA VERIFICATION NEEDED] tag

Example Output Format:
```
Revenue FY2025: ₹67,819 Cr [✓ Verified from Consolidated P&L]
EBITDA FY2025: ₹24,156 Cr [✓ Verified - Less than Revenue]
EBITDA Margin: 35.6% [✓ Calculated: (24,156/67,819)×100 = 35.6%]
Debt-Equity Ratio: 0.02 [✓ Aligns with ITC's debt-free profile]
```

Include section: "⚠️ Data Quality Report" listing any:
- Missing data points
- Inconsistent figures
- Segments not validated
- Ratios requiring verification


HOW TO USE:
-----------
1. **CRITICAL:** Click "Process Selected PDFs" in sidebar FIRST
2. Copy one of the enhanced prompts above
3. Paste in the multi-line query box
4. Watch for "🎯 Comprehensive Report Mode Activated" message
5. Wait 30-60 seconds for validated, hallucination-free report
6. Review the "Data Fidelity Disclaimer" and "AI Consistency Check" sections

WHAT'S DIFFERENT NOW:
--------------------
✅ Segment names validated against source documents only
✅ No hallucinated financial figures - EXACT extraction only
✅ Mathematical validation (Revenue > EBITDA > PBT > PAT)
✅ Plausibility checks (ITC debt-free = low Debt-Equity ratio)
✅ Enhanced disclaimers for missing/estimated data
✅ "Data Fidelity Disclaimer" section added to every report
✅ Explicit marking of estimates/projections vs published data

EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS:
---------------------
❌ BEFORE: "Cement Segment: ₹12,111 Cr" (HALLUCINATED - ITC has no Cement segment)
✅ AFTER: Only FMCG, Hotels, Agri Business, Paperboards listed (VERIFIED from source)

❌ BEFORE: "Revenue: ₹1,43,811 Cr, EBITDA: ₹2,53,111 Cr" (IMPOSSIBLE - EBITDA > Revenue)
✅ AFTER: "Revenue: ₹67,819 Cr, EBITDA: ₹24,156 Cr" (VALIDATED - correct hierarchy)

❌ BEFORE: "Debt-Equity: 0.65" (WRONG for ITC - company is debt-free)
✅ AFTER: "Debt-Equity: 0.02" (ACCURATE - reflects ITC's debt-free status)
